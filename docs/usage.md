# Usage

AIPscan was developed to provide a more in-depth reporting solution for
Archivematica users. It crawls METS files from AIPs in the Archivematica Storage
Service to generate tabular and visual reports about repository holdings. It is
designed to run as a stand-alone add-on to Archivematica. It only needs a valid
Storage Service API key to fetch source data.

This documentation is a work in progress.
