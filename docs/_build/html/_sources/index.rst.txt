Welcome to AIPscan's documentation!
===================================

AIPscan is a utility developed by Artefactual Systems Inc. The utility
is currently a web-app that can retrieve the contents of the AIPs
stored in multiple storage services to then convert the information
they contain into a database serialization which can support repository
management and digital preservation planning.

The contents of this package are described below. Some additional work
is needed to improve this!
