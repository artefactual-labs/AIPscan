business_criticality: operational

business_overview:
  description: AIPscan was developed to provide a more in-depth reporting solution for Archivematica users. It crawls METS files from AIPs in the Archivematica Storage Service to generate tabular and visual reports about repository holdings. It is designed to run as a stand-alone add-on to Archivematica. It only needs a valid Storage Service API key to fetch source data.

technical_overview:
  description: AIPscan is a web-based application that is built using the Python [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) micro-framework.

questions:

abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As a criminal I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to take the archives offline.
  CPU-Cycle Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal CPU cycles in order to transform them into money via installed crypto currency miners.
  Ransomware: >
    As a criminal I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a criminal I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage their repudiation by publishing the stolen data.
  Defacement: >
    As a criminal I want to modify the backend system (Archivematica) for political purposes.

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  EU-GDPR: Mandatory EU-GDPR

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
