AIPscan provides an in-depth reporting solution for Archivematica users. It
crawls METS files from AIPs in the Archivematica Storage Service to generate
tabular and visual reports about repository holdings. It is designed to run as a
stand-alone add-on to Archivematica and requires only a valid Storage Service
API key to fetch source data.
